# MorseSet

The goal of this project was to extract the Morse Sets defined as strongly connected component regions in the flow. For the first time, we propose a method to extract the Morse Sets in piece-wise linear vector field. The input of this software is the velocity fields data for 3D datasets and the output is the extracted Morse sets. 
This software implemented in C++ (windows) using two libraries of Qt and CUDA. 


## Description
This software has three features:
- Visualizing the streamlines.
- Extract the Morse sets in different levels.
- Visualizaing the Morse sets.

## Binding to Other libraries
I used 
- [CUDA7.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-75-downloads-archive)
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/)
